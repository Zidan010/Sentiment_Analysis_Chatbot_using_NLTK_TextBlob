# Sentiment_Analysis_Chatbot_using_NLTK_TextBlob

This project demonstrates a simple sentiment analysis chatbot that analyzes the user's mood based on their input and provides contextual responses. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and sentiment analysis to interpret the sentiment of user text.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**:

  - Spell Correction: Automatically corrects spelling errors in user input.
